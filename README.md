# corelibs

Core Libraries we use with various Python Packages that we maintain.

## USAGE

This is primarily used with other packages. Currently, it's useful 
to automatically locate the configuration files for our demo projects,
but the space remains open to be used with other projects.

## INSTALLATION

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```
